SenseCAP S2100 Data Logger can connect to MODBUS-RTU RS485/Analog/GPIO sensors and transmit data from sensors to the LoRaWAN network. Benefits from LoRa and IP66 design, this device features stability and reliability and can cover a long transmission range while keeping ultra-low power consumption, ideal for outdoor use. It is specifically optimized for OTA with built-in Bluetooth, which enables quick setup and update. It can be battery-powered or connected to a 12V external power supply. When the 12V power supply is connected, the replaceable built-in battery is set to be used as the backup power supply. What's more, with the help of S2110 converter, S2100 Data Logger is able to connect to Grove Sensor, it is an ideal solution for developing, fast prototyping, and small deployment for DIY Industrial level LoRaWAN Sensors.


Features
------------
- Strong Compatibility with different Sensors: supports all MODBUS-RTU RS485/Analog(4 ~ 20mA/0~10V) / GPIO(level/pulse) sensors.
- Compatible with Worldwide LoRaWAN® Networks: Compatible with LoRaWAN® V1.0.3 protocol and can work with LoRaWAN® gateway. (support the universal frequency plan from 863MHz ~928MHz).
- Long Range & replaceable Battery powered: With LoRaWAN® wireless transmission, S2100 supports 19Ah built-in battery and external 12V DC to supply devices, and ultra-wide-transmission range of 2km in urban scenes and 10km in line of sight scenes.
- Designed to Use in Harsh Environments: -40℃ ~ 85℃ operating temperature and IP66 rated enclosure, suitable for outdoor use, high UV exposure, heavy rain, dusty conditions, etc.
- Remote configuration and management: Seeed provides SenseCAP Mate APP and SenseCAP Portal, allows users to remotely manage data and configure.

Power Source Option
------------
- Option 1: the data logger can work in Periodic mode. Powered by a built-in 19Ah Standard D-size Li-SOCl2 battery which is easy to buy online, it can be installed and deployed in an outdoor environment without additional power.


- Option 2: the data logger can work in Constant Power mode with an external 12V DC power supply. We provide a matching Junction Box Kit so that the data logger can be quickly assembled.

Support Industrial Sensors of Different Interfaces
------------
S2100 LoRaWAN Data Logger is a single-channel collector, and only supports one of the following protocols at one time:

RS485: Support standard RS485 Modbus-RTU protocol
Analog: 2 x 0 ~ 10V or 2 x 4 ~ 20mA.
GPIO: 1 x GPIO, collect level or pulse signal
